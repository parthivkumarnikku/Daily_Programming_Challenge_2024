## **Daily Challenge**
### **Practice Challange - 01**
![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/01-September%201st%202024-brightgreen)
- **Challenge:** [Finding the kth largest number in an array without sorting]
- **Language specification:** None
- **Discreption:**
    - You are given an unsorted array of integers and a positive integer K.     Your task is to find the Kth largest element in the array. The Kth largest element is the element that would appear in the Kth position if the array were sorted in descending order.

        You need to implement a function that returns this Kth largest element without explicitly sorting the entire array.

        Example
        arr = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]
        k = 2
        Output: 5
- **Language used:** C

### **Practice Challange - 02**
![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/02-September%203rd%202024-brightgreen)
- **Challenge:** [Finding the median of an array with out sorting]
- **Language specification:** None
- **Discreption:**
    - Practice Question 2
      You are given an unsorted array of integers. 
      Your task is to find the median of the array. 
      The median is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. 
      If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
      Implement a function that returns the median of the array **without explicitly sorting** the entire array.

      *Example* :
        arr = [3,2,1,4,5];
        output = 3

        arr = [7,10,4,3,20,15]
        output = 8.5

### **Challange DAY - 01**
![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/03-September%209th%202024-brightgreen)
- **Challenge:** [Sorting an array containing only 0's ,1's and 2's]
- **Language specification:** Any
- **Discreption:**
    - **Problem**: *Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s.*
      *You are given an array arr consisting only of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to sort    the array in increasing order in linear time (i.e., O(n)) without using any extra space.*
      *This means you need to rearrange the array in-place.*
    - **Input**:
      *An integer array arr of size n where each element is either 0, 1, or 2.*
      **Example** *: arr = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]*
    - **Output**:
        *The sorted array, arranged in increasing order of 0s, 1s, and 2s.*
        **Example** *: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]*

### **Challange DAY - 02**
![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/04-September%2010th%202024-brightgreen)
- **Challenge:** [Finding missing numbers from set of consiquetive numbers in an array]
- **Language specification:** Any
- **Discreption:**
    - **Problem**: *Find the missing number*
          *You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence.            Your task is to find the missing integer.*
    - **Input**:
      *An integer array arr of size n-1 where the elements are distinct and taken from the range 1 to n.*
      **Example** *: arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]*
    - **Output**:
        *Return the missing integer from the array.*
        **Example** *: "Missing Number : 3"*

### **Challange DAY - 03**
![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/05-September%2011th%202024-brightgreen)
- **Challenge:** [Finding the repeated elements/duplicates in the given array]
- **Language specification:** Any
- **Discreption:**
    - **Problem**: *Find the duplicate number*
      *You are given an array arr containing n+1 integers, where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is exactly one duplicate number in the array, but it may appear more than once. Your task is to find the duplicate number without modifying the array and using constant extra space.*
    - **Input**:
      *An integer array arr of size n+1, where each element is an integer in the range [1, n].*
      **Example:** *arr = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]*
    - **Output**:
        *Return the duplicate integer present in the array.*
        **Example :** *Duplicate Number : 3*
    - [*Clink me for Detailed problem statement link*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MV-A97iJMh0Vr-JIhVOT5u59k4HWE8R-0gHept2FRFw/edit?usp=sharing)
    

- **Language used:** C
- **My Solution:** [Link to the Solution Code](./DAY-3_11-09-2024/Duplicate_inside_array.c)
- **Info:**
    - *DAY 3 question to find the duplocate is done , but it has a comlexity of o(n^2), There is a method called **floids circle** which has the complexity O(1); since the question didnot mention about complexity in time, i have done this with the complexity of O(n^2) and soon there will be a update with new code.*
